# AVAX-Intermediate---Module-3-Project

## Description

This program is a simple contract that creates a token using the ERC20 contract. Using ERC20 on your contract already provides you with default functions. Because of that, to meet the project requirements, the following functions were added:
- mint: Takes in an address and an integer input. Mints a specified value of tokens for a specified contract.
- burn: Takes in an integer input. Burns a specified amount of tokens for the current address.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, it is recommended to use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., MyToken.sol). Copy and paste the [project code](https://github.com/SSSerpenttt/AVAX-Intermediate---Module-3-Project/blob/main/Avax%20Intermediate%20-%20Module%203%20Project.sol) into the file you just created.

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "^0.8.26" (or another compatible version) and then click on the "Compile..." button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the contract from the dropdown menu, input the address you want to declare as the owner from the available list of accounts, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, expand the drop down bar of your deployed contract. You can interact with it through the following:
- mint: Takes in an address and an integer input. Mints a specified value of tokens for a specified contract.
- burn: Takes in an integer input. Burns a specified amount of tokens for the current address.
